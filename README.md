# Pull-to-Refresh-with-RecyclerView

üì± An Android Studio project that demonstrates how to use the SwipeRefreshLayout widget to implement a swipe-to-refresh user interface design pattern.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open it in Android Studio. Then, build and run the project on an Android device or emulator.

## üí° Usage

When the app is running, you'll see a list of items that can be refreshed by swiping down on the screen. When you swipe down, the SwipeRefreshLayout widget will display a progress bar and trigger the onRefresh() method in the app.

To customize the behavior of the onRefresh() method, implement the SwipeRefreshLayout.OnRefreshListener interface in your activity or fragment and override the onRefresh() method.

    public class MyActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements SwipeRefreshLayout.OnRefreshListener {

        private SwipeRefreshLayout swipeRefreshLayout;

        @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            setContentView(R.layout.activity_my);
    
            swipeRefreshLayout = findViewById(R.id.swipe_refresh_layout);
            swipeRefreshLayout.setOnRefreshListener(this);
        }
    
        @Override
        public void onRefresh() {
            // Do something when the user swipes down to refresh
        }
    }
